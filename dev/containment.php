                    </header>
                    <p>The gameplay consisted of a game world filled with people, some of which carry a disease. The playerâ€™s goal is to find the 'carriers' of the disease, as they are the ones spreading it without showing any symptoms themselves. Gameplay boils down to closely watching people's movement as they die from the disease and try to identify the carrier before time runs out. </p>

                    <p>Continued collaboration between me and one of the software developers sought to develop the title into a Unity game for mobile. While the project never got far off the ground, we did produce a prototype and represents my first serious venture into mobile and Unity territory.  </p>
